Absolutely! Here are ten challenges designed to test your understanding of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java. Try to solve them to practice and reinforce your knowledge of these concepts.

**Challenge 1: Abstraction**

Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea()`. Then, create three concrete subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`, each implementing the `calculateArea()` method to calculate the area of the respective shape.

**Challenge 2: Encapsulation**

Create a class `Employee` with private data members `name`, `age`, and `salary`. Implement public getter and setter methods for each data member. Ensure that the `age` cannot be negative, and the `salary` cannot be set to a negative value.

**Challenge 3: Inheritance**

Create a class `Vehicle` with a method `startEngine()`. Then, create two subclasses `Car` and `Motorcycle`, each with its own `startEngine()` method to print a unique message. Use inheritance to reuse the `Vehicle` method and override it in the subclasses.

**Challenge 4: Polymorphism**

Create a class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Then, create three subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`, each with its own implementation of the `makeSound()` method. Write a method that takes an `Animal` object as a parameter and calls its `makeSound()` method.

**Challenge 5: Abstract and Interface**

Create an abstract class `BankAccount` with abstract methods `withdraw()` and `deposit()`. Then, create a concrete class `SavingsAccount` that extends `BankAccount`. Finally, create an interface `InterestBearing` with a method `calculateInterest()`. Have `SavingsAccount` implement the `InterestBearing` interface.

**Challenge 6: Encapsulation and Constructor**

Create a class `Book` with private data members `title`, `author`, and `year`. Implement a constructor that takes these values as arguments and initializes the object. Add public getter methods for each data member.

**Challenge 7: Inheritance and Overriding**

Create a class `Shape` with a method `draw()` that prints "Drawing a shape." Then, create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`, each with its own `draw()` method that prints a unique message. Test the overriding behavior by creating objects of both subclasses and calling the `draw()` method.

**Challenge 8: Polymorphism and Interface**

Create an interface `Playable` with a method `play()`. Then, create two classes `Video` and `Audio` that implement the `Playable` interface. Write a method that takes an array of `Playable` objects as a parameter and calls their `play()` method.

**Challenge 9: Encapsulation and Setter Validation**

Create a class `Person` with private data members `name` and `age`. Implement setter methods for `name` and `age`. The `age` setter should validate that the age is between 0 and 120 (inclusive). If not, set the age to 0.

**Challenge 10: Polymorphism and ArrayList**

Create a class hierarchy of different animals. Implement a method that takes an ArrayList of animals as input and prints the sound made by each animal using the `makeSound()` method.

Feel free to take your time to solve these challenges. They cover various aspects of object-oriented programming and will undoubtedly help you reinforce your understanding of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java.
